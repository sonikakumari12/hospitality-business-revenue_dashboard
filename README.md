## Workflow Overview

The workflow for this project follows a **Power BI-centric data analytics pipeline**:

[Data Sources] --> [Data Cleaning & Transformation in Power BI] --> [Power BI Dashboard Development] --> [Insights & Decision-Making]

### Stage Details

1. **Data Collection**
   - For demonstration purposes, a synthetic dataset was created using GPT to simulate real-world hospitality revenue data. 
   - Data includes metrics such as bookings, occupancy, revenue per room, and seasonal trends.

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
   - Perform all data cleaning and transformation within **Power BI** using Power Query and DAX formulas.  
   - Clean raw data, remove duplicates, handle missing values, and transform data to calculate key metrics such as occupancy rate, average daily rate (ADR), and revenue per available room (RevPAR).

3. **Dashboard Development**
   - Build interactive Power BI dashboards using the cleaned and transformed data.  
   - Add slicers and filters for dynamic analysis by time period, property, or room type.

4. **Insights & Decision-Making**
   - Analyze trends in bookings, occupancy, and revenue.  
   - Support pricing strategies based on seasonal demand patterns.  
   - Forecast revenue and optimize operations to improve profitability.
